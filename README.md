# BuddyChat
## Chat room project for vital buddy communication :D

- Phase 1: Setting up the web framework. I made sure to download Node.js for this part of the project. Installing Docker Desktop as its great for "building, sharing, and running containerized applications". I also installed Express.js dependency.

Skils:  Real‑time communication, WebSockets, backend + frontend integration.
